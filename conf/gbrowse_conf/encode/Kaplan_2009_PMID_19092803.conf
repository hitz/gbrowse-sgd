                  Kaplan et al. measured the occupancy of nucleosomes assembled on purified yeast genomic DNA (in vitro map) as well as three conditions in vivo (YPD, YPEtOH, YPGal) genome-wide to produce nucleosome maps, the former being governed
                  only by the intrinsic sequence preferences of nucleosomes.<br/><br/>

                  <b><i>in vitro</i>, YPD, YPEtOH, YPGal:</b> <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> nucleosome occupancy in yeasts measured under each respective condition.<br/><br/>
                  <b>Average normalized occupancy:</b> the log-normalized predicted probability for each position in the genome to be covered by a nucleosome, under an assumed equilibrium between all feasible (i.e., non-overlapping) nucleosome configurations.<br/><br/>
                  <b>Model prediction score:</b> the computational model score assigned to each 147bp sequence in the genome for its positioning potential, based on the measured in vitro sequence preference data.<br/><br/>
                  Note that the values in the GBrowse display are scaled as standard deviations from the mean (Z-scores).
