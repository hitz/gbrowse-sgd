                  Field et al. applied 454 pyrosequencing technology to generate a genome-wide map of approximately 380,000 nucleosomes in budding yeast to look at the functional consequences of nucleosome position encoding by the genome.<br/><br/>
                  <b>Nucleosome sequenced read count:</b> the number of mapped nucleosome reads (i.e. the in vivo measured "nucleosome occupancy") over each base pair in the yeast genome.<br/><br/>
                  <b>Predicted average nucleosome occupancy:</b> the predicted probability for each position in the genome to be covered by any nucleosome, under an assumed equilibrium between all feasible (i.e., non overlapping) nucleosome configurations.<br/><br>
                  <b>Predicted nucleosome potential score:</b> the score assigned by the authors' computational model to each 147bp sequence in the genome for positioning potential of the sequence.<br/><br/>
                  Note that the values in the GBrowse display are scaled as standard deviations from the mean (Z-scores).
