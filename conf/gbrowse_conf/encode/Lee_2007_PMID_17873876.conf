                  Lee et al. measured the genome-wide occupancy of S. cerevisiae nucleosomes using tiling arrays, identifying over 70,000 positionined nucleosomes occupying 81% of the genome.<br/><br/>
                  <b>Nucleosome occupancy (log ratio):</b> The normalized log ratios determined by the Affymetrix Tiling Analysis Software probe signal intensity analysis using three nucleosomal experiments as 'treatment' and three whole-genome samples as 'control' in a two-sample analysis of the measured tiling array intensities.<br/><br/>
                  <b>Predicted nucleosome occupancy (lasso model):</b> The output value of a linear regression model (Lasso) built using sequence-based inputs that are known or thought to influence nucleosome positioning (refer to paper for list of features), trained on the measured tiling array data over chromosomes 1 to 8.<br/><br/>
                  Note that the values in the GBrowse display are scaled as standard deviations from the mean (Z-scores).
