                  Qi et al. crossed S288C with RM11 to obtain a diploid with a large number of sequence polymorphisms and induced meiosis to obtain a
                  number of tetrads with meiotic spores. One set of four spores was cultured in rich medium, and their DNA sequenced using the
                  454 technology to investigate meiotic recombination events at high resolution.
