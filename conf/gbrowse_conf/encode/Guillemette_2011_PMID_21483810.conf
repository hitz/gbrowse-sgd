citation	= <b>Guillemette B, Drogaris P, Lin HH, Armstrong H, Hiragami-Hamada K, Imhof A, Bonneil E, Thibault P, Verreault A, Festenstein RJ (2011) H3 lysine 4 is acetylated at active gene promoters and is regulated by H3 lysine 4 methylation. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21483810">[PMID:21483810]</a></b><br/><br/>
                  Guillemette et al. showed that histone H3 was acetylated at lysine 4 (H3K4ac) in budding yeast 
                  and examined its distribution genome wide, finding it to be enriched at promoters of actively 
                  transcribed genes and located just upstream of H3K4 trimethylation marks (H3K4me3).
                  Note that the values in the GBrowse display are scaled as standard deviations from the mean (Z-scores).
