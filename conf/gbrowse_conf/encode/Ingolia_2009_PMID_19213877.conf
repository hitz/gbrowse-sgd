                  Ingolia et al. developed a ribosome-profiling method based on deep sequencing of ribosome-protected fragments to study translation with subcodon resolution in S. cerevisiae under both
                  rich and starvation conditions.<br/><br/>
                  Canonical upstream ORFs (uORFs) were identified by finding AUG codons within annotated 5'UTRs and determination of the following open reading frame. Footprints were assigned to uORFs when
                  they started no more than 14 nucleotides before the start of the uORF, and ended no more than 15 nucleotides before the end of the uORF or 21 nucleotides before the start of the downstream
                  protein-coding gene. "Initiation context scores were computed using a weight matrix model devised by Miyasaka (Yeast, 1999) based on the start codon context of highly-expressed genes. 
                  The weight matrix scores six nucleotides before the start codon as well as three nucleotides after."
